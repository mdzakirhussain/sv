# 1. uvm_phase  

This is a base_class defines everything about a phase: behavior, state, and context.  
To define behavior, it is extended by UVM or the user to create singleton objects which capture the definition of what the phase does and how it does it. These are then cloned to produce multiple nodes which are hooked up in a graph structure to provide context: which phases follow which, and to hold the state of the phase throughout its lifetime.  

## Phase Definition  

These instances define the attributes of the phase (not what state it is in) They are then cloned into schedule nodes which point back to one of these implementations, and calls its virtual task or function methods on each participating component.  

## Phase Context  

A schedule is a coherent group of one or more phase/state nodes linked together by a graph structure, allowing arbitrary linear/parallel relationships to be specified, and executed by stepping through them in the graph order. Each schedule node points to a phase and holds the execution state of that phase, and has optional links to other nodes for synchronization.  

The main operations are: construct, add phases, and instantiate hierarchically within another schedule.  

Each instance is a node connected to others to form the graph. Each node in the graph has zero or more successors, and zero or more predecessors. No nodes are completely isolated from others. Exactly one node has zero predecessors. This is the root node. Also the graph is acyclic, meaning for all nodes in the graph, by following the forward arrows you will never end up back where you started but you will eventually reach a node that has no successors.  

## Phase State  

A given phase may appear multiple times in the complete phase graph, due to the multiple independent domain feature, and the ability for different VIP to customize their own phase schedules perhaps reusing existing phases. Each node instance in the graph maintains its own state of execution.  

**Key points that we have to know for understand working of all phases**  

* Each testbench component is derived from uvm_component that has predefined phases. They are represented as callback methods.  
* Each component can not move to the next phase unless the current phase execution is completed for all the components. This provides proper synchronization between all the components. UVM phases are executed in a certain order and all are virtual methods.  
* Few phases that consume simulation time for execution are implemented as tasks and other phases that do not consume any simulation time are implemented as functions.  
Main categories in UVM phases.  
a. Build phases: Used to configure or construct the testbench.  
b. Run-time phases: Time-consuming testbench activity like running the test case.  
c. Clean up phases: Collect and report the results of the simulation.  

**syntax**:
```
class uvm_phase extends uvm_object;

   `uvm_object_utils(uvm_phase)

endclass
```

## BUILD_PHASE

UVM Phases are a synchronizing mechanism for the environment. Phases are represented by callback methods, A set of predefined phases and corresponding callbacks are provided in uvm_component. The Method can be either a function or task.  
Any class deriving from uvm_component may implement any or all of these callbacks, which are executed in a particular order  

The top-level is a test and that test builds the testbench. In order to do this, the build_phase is necessary. The build_phase is the first phase in the flow and is the one of the phase that is called in a top-down manner starting with the test. Its purpose is to create all of the UVM components.  
There are a few key points you need to remember for this phase.
1. Every build_phase function should call super.build_phase first so that the build_phase function in the parent class is executed.
2. Configuration for a component should be done before a component is created.
3. All UVM components should be created in this phase.

The **uvm_build_phase** phase implementation method.  

1. Any override should call super.build_phase(phase) to execute the automatic configuration of fields registered in the component by calling <apply_config_settings>.  
2. To turn off automatic configuration for a component, do not call super.build_phase(phase).  

**syntax**:  

`virtual function void build_phase(uvm_phase phase);`

**code snippet**:  
```
`include "uvm_macros.svh"
import uvm_pkg::*;

class object extends uvm_object;
   `uvm_object_utils(object)
   
   rand int a;
   rand int b;
  
   function new(string name = "object");
      super.new(name);
   endfunction
endclass

class test extends uvm_test;

   object obj;

   function new(string name = "test",uvm_component parent = null);

## End of elaboration phase   
Basically phases are used for synchronization between testbench components. These phases are nothing but predefined functions and tasks provided in uvm_component. Each component will goes through these predefined phases and it proceed to next phase only when current phase gets executed.      
                        End of elaboration phase is a function which executes at 0 simulation time. It comes under BUILD phase.In the predefined order this phase comes before start of simulation phase and comes after connect phase. End of elaboration phase executes in bottom to top methodology. In End of elaboration phase verification environment has been assembled.                
**Functions of End of elaboration phase**:  
1. It displays uvm topology it means structure of the design which is hierarchical information.  
2. It is used to make final time adjustments and changes to structure, configuration in testbench architecture before simulation.  
3. It  opens the files and define additional configuration settings
4. It is used to display startup simulation messages.  
**Class Hierarchy**:   
The complete phasing mechanism is subdivided into 3 phases: uvm_topdown_phase, uvm_bottomup_phase and uvm_task_phase.  
uvm_void   
uvm_object  
uvm_phase  
uvm_bottom_up phase    
**Class Declaration**:

## Start of simulation phase
  
Start of simulation phase is also a function in which simulation takes place at 0ns.This phase comes before actual simulation that is before RUN phase. Start of simulation phase is also a bottom to top methodology. Both End of elaboration and Start of simulation phase executes in bottom to top methodology because for printing topology, adjusting of the environment, accessing configuration information and this can only be possible in hierarchical fashion in bottom up only after build phase finish its execution. It belongs to run time phase so run phase will get executed from start of simulation phase .Generally both  End of elaboration and Start of simulation phase are used for displaying uvm hierarchy information.  
**Functions in Start of simulation phase:**    
1.It displays environment topology this is also done in  End of elaboration phase but any changes and additional modification settings are displayed in start of simulation phase.  
2.set debugger breakpoint  
3.set initial run time configuration values.  
4.In this phase simulation engines ,debuggers, runtime tools have started and synced  
5.verification  environment is configured and ready to be started  
**Class Hierarchy**:   
The complete phasing mechanism is subdivided into 3 phases: uvm_topdown_phase, uvm_bottomup_phase and uvm_task_phase.

>**Note:** 

1.UVM_phases are derived from the uvm_phase class.

2.We can also write a task _run_phase_ instead of writing all the methods mentioned above. In that case, all the pre-defined methods are called by default and executed in the background.

3.Even if we write these tasks(sub_phases) randomly,automatically it will runs in the order as mentiond above.

4.However all of the sub-phases execute in serial order,we would not use the run_phase together with sub_phases.

5.The uvm_phase checks if any objections are raised by the components. The phase_done is the uvm_objection object that the uvm_phase keeps track of the number of objections with. When we called phase.raise_objection() from inside the run_phase of the perticular class, phase_done.raise_objection() is called in the uvm_phase under the hood.   



# 3. Clean up phase 

The clean-up phases are used to collect information from functional coverage monitors and scoreboards to see whether the coverage goal has been reached or the test case has passed. All the results are collected and reported in this phase, like for example the number of error’s during the simulation can be  reported. The cleanup phases will start once the run phases are completed. They are implemented as functions and work from the bottom to the top of the component hierarchy.

## Extract phase

This phase is used to retrieve and process the information from functional coverage monitors and scoreboards. This phase may also calculate any statistical information that will be used by report phase.   

**Code snippet**:-  
```
virtual function void extract_phase (uvm_phase phase);
   super.extract_phase(phase);
   `uvm_info("extract",$sformatf("All values of y in queue q are %0p",q),UVM_LOW)
   
endfunction
``` 

## Check phase  

This phase is used to check that the DUT behaved correctly and to identify any errors that may have occurred during the execution of the test bench.  

**Code snippet**:-  
```
virtual function void check_phase(uvm_phase phase);

   super.check_phase(phase);
   if(count_for_randomization == req.value)
      `uvm_info("check","All randomized values recieved",UVM_LOW)
   else
      `uvm_info("check","Some randomized values are missing",UVM_LOW)

endfunction
```      

## Report phase

This phase is used to display the results of the simulation or to write the results to file.  

**Code snippet**:-  
```
virtual function void report_phase(uvm_phase phase);

   super.report_phase(phase);
   file = $fopen("report_for_driver","w");
   $fdisplay(file,"Total no of randomizations happend are %0d",count_for_randomization);
   $fdisplay(file,"All randomized values of a are %0d",req.a);
   $fdisplay(file,"All randomized values of b are %0d",req.b);
   $fdisplay(file,"Outputs of y are %0p",q);
   $fclose(file);

endfunction
```  

## Final phase

Used to complete any outstanding actions(like closing files and terminate co-simulation engines) that are yet to be completed in the testbench.  

**Code snippet**:-  
```
virtual function void final_phase(uvm_phase phase);
    	
   super.final_phase(phase);
   `uvm_info("final","final phase is working",UVM_LOW)
    
endfunction  
```

## 4. User defined phase  

UVM supports user defined phases that are customizable by the user.These can be inserted anywhere.  
Steps to create a custom phase :  
  
### Define phase  
We create a phase by extending it from appropriate base class `uvm_task_phase`,`uvm_topdown_phase`,` uvm_bottomup_phase`.  If your phase consumes time extend it from uvm_task_phase else go with the requirement.Implement `exec_task` or `exec_func`.   
  
    class u_phase extends uvm_topdown_phase;                                                            
     static local u_phase up;                                                                          
     function new(string n="u_phase");                                                                 
       super.new(n);                                                                                   
     endfunction                                                                                       
                                                                                                      
     virtual function string get_type_name();                                                          
     return "user_defined_phase";                                                                      
     endfunction                                                                                       
                                                                                                       
     static function u_phase get();                                                                    
     if (up==null) begin                                                                               
      up=new();                                                                                        
     end                                                                                               
     return up;                                                                                        
     endfunction                                                                                       
                                                                                                       
     virtual function void exec_func(uvm_component comp,uvm_phase phase);                              
     comp.parent=null;                                                                                 
     //display("in the function");                                                                     
     `uvm_info(get_full_name(),$sformatf("in %s phase",phase.get_name()),UVM_MEDIUM);                  
     endfunction                                                                                       
    endclass     
Here we extended a user defined phase from `uvm_topdown_phase` base class. And in the `exec_func` which is the predefined function that is to be overridden so that the defined function is done as per requirement,we are just printing an info regarding phase.   
 
### Insert into a schedule    
Inorder to execute a phase it must be added into a domain and that domain is inserted into a schedule.A domain is a phasing schedule node representing an independent branch of schedule.We can insert the new user defined phase in between any of the existing phases. And to do so we need to create a handle for the uvm phase scheduler or domain.     
We can do that in the following ways:    
   **By using the handles of domain and phase.**  

    uvm_domain d=uvm_domain::get_common_domain();                                                     
    uvm_phase up=d.find(uvm_build_phase::get());  
    d.add(user_phase::get(),null,up,null);   
In this we use handles for `uvm_domain` and `uvm_phase` for adding the user defined phase `u_phase` into the domain.In `add`, The first field is 'instance_field',that should return an instance of a phase,second field is 'with_field',that should represent a phase along with which the user phase should be run,third and fourth fields are 'after and before_fields', to specify the phase after and before which the user phase should be run/inserted respectively. Here the user phase is inserted after `build_phase` as specified.  
* Both 'with_field' and 'after and before_fields' cannot be given at the same time as they lead to contradiction. So one should be null for other to happen.      

**Without any handles**  
                                                 
    uvm_domain::get_common_domain().add(u_phase::get(),null,uvm_build_phase::get(),null);  
Here without any handles we are adding the user defined phase into the domain.  

### Use the defined phase      

     class test extends uvm_test;                                                                        
     `uvm_component_utils(test)                                                                        
     function new(string n="test",uvm_component p=null);                                               
     super.new(n,p);                                                                                                                                                                  
     endfunction                                                                                       
                                                                              
     virtual task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);

Here we created a user defined phase `u_phase` and inserted it after build_phase, as we did mention `before_field` to null,the `u_phase` will be executed just after build_phase.
