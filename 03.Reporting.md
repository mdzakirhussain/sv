# Reporting mechanism

The command $display is commonly used to show information and report results in a verification environment. Controlling the display statements can become difficult as design would require frequent re-compilations and hence it becomes time consuming. 

To overcome such scenarios, UVM Reporting provides a set of displaying commands and methods to change the number and types of print-messaging in any testbench without re-compiling the design.

## UVM Reporting arguments

1. [uvm_severity](https://github.com/muneeb-mbytes/UVM_Course/wiki/03.Reporting#1uvm_severity)  
2. [uvm_verbosity](https://github.com/muneeb-mbytes/UVM_Course/wiki/03.Reporting#2uvm_verbosity)  
3. [uvm_action](https://github.com/muneeb-mbytes/UVM_Course/wiki/03.Reporting#3-uvm_action)

## 1.UVM_severity   

1. uvm_severity indicates the importance of the message to be displayed.  
2. Examples are info, warning, error and fatal.  

* **`uvm_info**

    Syntax: `uvm_info(ID, message, VERBOSITY); 

    ID - a unique id to form a group of messages.  
    message - The message text.  
    VERBOSITY - the verbosity of the message, and the default is UVM_MEDIUM. 

    Here VERBOSITY can be UVM_NONE, UVM_LOW, UVM_HIGH, UVM_MEDIUM, UVM_FULL, UVM_DEBUG.

 
* **`uvm_warning**  

    Syntax: `uvm_warning(ID, message);  

    Here by default verbosity is UVM_MEDIUM.  
    It generates the run time warning.

* **`uvm_error**  

    Syntax: `uvm_error(ID, message);  

    Here by default verbosity is UVM_LOW.   
    It emits an error severity message.


* **`uvm_fatal**  

    Syntax: `uvm_fatal(ID, message);

    Here by default verbosity is UVM_NONE.  
    It generates a run-time fatal error, which terminates the simulation. 



**Code**  

        `uvm_warning("TEST", "Warning occured");  
        `uvm_info("TEST","inoformation severity--1 (info_none)", UVM_NONE);  
        `uvm_info("TEST","information severity--2 (info_medium)", UVM_MEDIUM);  
        `uvm_info("TEST","information severity--3 (info_low)", UVM_LOW);  
        `uvm_error("TEST", "Error 1");  
        `uvm_error("TEST", "Error 2");   
        `uvm_fatal("TEST", "A fatal error has occurred")  


**Output**

The below figure shows the output of uvm_severity code. We can observe that, there is two information severity statements we're getting from package. So here it count even the info getting from package.

**Note:**   
* In place of ID, we can use get_full_name(), get_type_name(), get_name(). These are built in methods. 
       

**Code**

       `uvm_info("TEST","inoformation severity--1 (info_none)", UVM_NONE);
       `uvm_info(get_name(),"get_name() information severity--3 (info_low)", UVM_LOW);
       `uvm_info(get_full_name(),"get_full_name() inoformation severity--1 (info_none)", UVM_NONE);
       `uvm_info(get_type_name(),"get_type_name() information severity--2 (info_medium)", UVM_MEDIUM);

                                      Figure.4. Using other method for ID 


* In the above code snippet, we can observe that we've used TEST as first severity ID, where we'll get that ID name in output.  
* In second, we used get_name(), where we'll get full hierarchy of the testbench, i.e [uvm_test_top].  
* In third, we used get_full_name(), which is same as get_name().  
* At last, we used get_type_name(), where we'll get only class name which we created, i.e [test].

* In message, if you want to get values from input as display statement, we can use   
  `$sformatf("%0d", variable)`
  
      `uvm_info("DILIP", $sformatf("[UVM_NONE]value of d is %0d",d), UVM_NONE);

## UVM severity methods

* uvm_report_info(ID, message, VERBOSITY, filename, line);

   ID - a unique id to form a group of messages.  
   message - The message text  
   verbosity - the verbosity of the message and the default is UVM_MEDIUM.  
   filename/line - If required to print filename and line number from where the message is issued, use macros, as shown in below code snippet.    

* uvm_report_warning(ID, message, VERBOSITY, filename, line);  
  The the default is UVM_MEDIUM.

* uvm_report_error(ID, message, VERBOSITY, filename, line);  
   The the default is UVM_LOW.

* uvm_report_fatal(ID, message, VERBOSITY, filename, line);  
  The the default is UVM_NONE.

**code**  

      uvm_report_info("TEST","inoformation severity--1 (info_none)", UVM_NONE);
      uvm_report_info("TEST","inoformation severity--1 (info_none)", UVM_NONE,`__FILE__,`__LINE__);
      uvm_report_error("TEST", "Error 1",UVM_NONE,`__FILE__,`__LINE__);
      uvm_report_warning("TEST", "Warning occured", UVM_NONE,`__FILE__,`__LINE__);
      uvm_report_fatal("TEST", "A fatal error has occurred", UVM_NONE,`__FILE__,`__LINE__);

**Output**  

The below figure shows the output of uvm_severity method code. We can observe that, there is two information severity statements we're getting from package. So here it count even the info getting from package.

                                      Figure.5. UVM severity method output


* In the above code snippet, observe that in first method, we didn't use file and line, so in the output there is no filename and line number.  
* In the second method, there is a presence of file and line macro . So in the output there is a filename and line number.  
* In remaining method we used file and line, so we'll get filename and line number.  
* And for error, warning and fatal method, we can use any verbosity.

**Github Output link:** https://github.com/muneeb-mbytes/UVM_Course/blob/b7_team_kachori/reporting/severity_method/severity.log

**NOTE**

The main difference between severities and its method is, in output, i.e in severities we'll get filename and line number without mentioning its macros, but in case of function we'll not get without using macros.     


## Code Severity Control  
  
There are two methods listed here and the order of precedence from low to high   
we have a set of report severity override, which changes all reports of a given current severity to be new severity.  

We can also change a severity, by a combination of current severity and report ID using set report severity ID, override to change those reports to a new severity.  
Now these method calls are not hierarchically only affect a single component to which they are compiled.  
 
Also these methods can be called using a hierarchical path name so again call these inside of a test class,  
it gives you the ability to turn them on and off by switching between tests  

In order of percedence(low to high)  

* change a severity  
`set_report_severity_override(current_severity,new_severity)  `  

* change by severity ID pair  
`set_report_severity_id_override(current_severity, id, new_severity)`  

Example:  

    `include "uvm_macros.svh"  
     import uvm_pkg::*;  
 
    class driver extends uvm_driver;  
    `uvm_component_utils(driver)  
     function new(string name="",uvm_component parent);
     super.new(name, parent);
     endfunction
  
     task run_phase(uvm_phase phase);
     super.run_phase(phase);
    `uvm_warning("TEST", "warning occured");
    `uvm_info("TEST","information severity--1 (info_none)", UVM_NONE);
    `uvm_info("TEST","information severity--2 (info_medium)", UVM_MEDIUM);
    `uvm_info("TEST","information severity--3 (info_low)", UVM_LOW);
    `uvm_error("TEST", "Error 1"); 
    `uvm_error("TEST", "Error 2");
    `uvm_fatal("FATAL", "A fatal error has occurred") 
    endtask  
 
    endclass

    module top;
     driver dri;
     initial begin
     dri=driver::type_id::create("dri",null);
    
     dri.set_report_severity_override(UVM_ERROR,UVM_WARNING);    
     dri.set_report_severity_id_override(UVM_FATAL,"FATAL",UVM_ERROR);
     run_test();
     end
    endmodule  

explanation:  

*  The code is a driver class that extends the uvm_driver class.
*  It sets the report severity override to UVM_ERROR,UVM_WARNING, and UVM_FATAL.
*  Then it calls run_test() which is defined in the top module.
*  The code attempts to create a driver class with the name "dri" and then set the severity of all messages generated by that driver to UVM_ERROR, 
*  UVM_WARNING, or UVM_FATAL.
*  The code above also sets the severity id override for those messages to be "FATAL", which is then used as a value for the report severity id 
   override.
*  The last line in this code runs a test task that will generate some warnings and errors.

output explanation:  

* The code starts with a UVM_INFO severity.sv(14) at 0: reporter [TEST] warning occured.
* This is followed by a UVM_WARNING severity.sv(14) at 0: dri [TEST] warning occured, which is followed by a UVM_ERROR severity.sv(20) at 0: dri 
  [FATAL] A fatal error has occurred

## 2.UVM_Verbosity  
In UVM there are multiple levels of verbosity. such as UVM_NONE, UVM_LOW, UVM_MEDIUM (Default), UVM_HIGH, UVM_FULL, UVM_DEBUG. The default Verbosity is UVM_MEDIUM.In case of default Verbosity level i.e. UVM_MEDIUM, any messages with UVM_HIGH or above are filtered out.  

|SL.NO | verbosity_level | Verbosity_default_value | Description |
|---|----|--|----|
|1.| UVM_NONE | 0 |The Verbosity configuration is always be printed, it cannot be disabled|
|2.| UVM_LOW | 100 | The Verbosity configuration is printed if it is UVM_LOW and above i.e UVM_NONE|
|3.| UVM_MEDIUM | 200 | The Verbosity configuration is printed if it is UVM_MEDIUM and above i.e UVM_NONE, UVM_LOW |
|4.| UVM_HIGH | 300 | The Verbosity configuration is printed if it is UVM_HIGH and above i.e UVM_NONE, UVM_LOW, UVM_MEDIUM|
|5.| UVM_FULL | 400 | The Verbosity configuration is printed if it is UVM_FULL and above i.e all above Verbose level  |
|6.| UVM_DEBUG | 500 | The Verbosity configuration is printed if it is UVM_DEBUG and above i.e all above verbose level  |

                                  Table1: UVM VERBOSITY LEVEL
                       
Example1: In this example we use simple module with verbosity level including the uvm macros and importing uvm_pkg i.e all uvm class.  

**code snippet:**

        //Access to all uvm macros
        `include "uvm_macros.svh"
        //Access to all uvm pkg i.e all uvm class
        import uvm_pkg::*;

        module top;
         initial begin:B1
         //UVM_NONE is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED 
         `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm none i.e 0", UVM_NONE); 
         #5;  
         //UVM_NONE is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED 
         `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm low i.e 100", UVM_LOW);  
         #5;  
         //UVM_MEDIUM is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED
         `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm medium i.e 200", UVM_MEDIUM);  
         #5; 
         //UVM_LOW is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED 
         `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm low i.e 100", UVM_LOW);  
         #5;  
         //UVM_LOW is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED
         `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm low i.e 100", UVM_LOW);
         #5; 
         //UVM_LOW is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED 
         `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm none i.e 0", UVM_NONE);  
         end:B1  
        endmodule      

**OUTPUT:**  
Here in the below figure shows the output for the different verbosity level

Example2: In this example we use simple module with Verbosity values, including the uvm macros and importing uvm_pkg i.e all uvm class.  

**code snippet:**

         //Access to all uvm macros
         `include "uvm_macros.svh"
         //Access to all uvm pkg i.e all uvm class
         import uvm_pkg::*;

          //UVM_NONE is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED
          `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm none i.e 0", 0);  
          #5;  
          //UVM_NONE is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED
          `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm low i.e 100", 100);

          //UVM_MEDIUM is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED  
          `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm medium i.e 200", 200); 
          #5; 
          //UVM_LOW is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED  
          `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm low i.e 100", 100); 
          #5;
          //UVM_LOW is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED   
          `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm low i.e 100", UVM_LOW); 
          #5;  
          //UVM_LOW is LOWER THEN UVM_DEFAULT IT IS PRINTED 
          `uvm_info("TOP", "verbosity level is uvm none i.e 0", UVM_NONE);
          end:B1  
         endmodule      

**OUTPUT:**  
Here, in this figure we know that we can also pass the default verbosity level values instead of using uvm verbosity level.

Important Notes:

* A message with the Verbosity level UVM_NONE cannot be disabled.
* Verbosity level cannot filter out the uvm_fatal, uvm_error & uvm_warning.    
-------
We can set the Verbosity level of a uvm_component individually or hierarchically using following commands:

command:  
`class_handle_name.set_report_verbosity_level(UVM_VERBOSITY);`  
Example:  
`env.set_report_verbosity_level(UVM_HIGH);`

**OUTPUT:**  
Here, in the below figure shows the output for verbosity level where we set the level of verbosity, the run_test(); will give the UVM_report about severity, the verbosity level is used only for `uvm_info. if we do not set verbosity level it will by default execute the statement which is equal to UVM_MEDIUM and above verbosity levels

--------
To Know the value of the UVM_verbosity_level which we have set using set verbosity command, we use the below command   
Command:  
`class_handle.get_report_verbosity_level()`  
Example4:    
`drv.get_report_verbosity_level()`  

Example.5: To get the UVM verbosity level of uvm_component and print the statements

 **code snippet:** 

      //Access the all uvm macros
      `include "uvm_macros.svh"
      //Access the uvm package i.e uvm class
      import uvm_pkg::*;
   
     //component class
     class driver extends uvm_driver;

      //factory registration
      `uvm_component_utils(driver); 

      //All component in the uvm base class as default constructor expecting two arguments
      function new(string name = "", uvm_component parent);
      super.new(name,parent);

      //Here we creating the object, using factory overriding
      drv = driver::type_id::create("drv",null);
  
      //To Know the UVM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITE VALUE
      $display("To get the verbosity level value", drv.get_report_verbosity_level());
      run_test();
      end
     endmodule

**OUTPUT:**  
Here, in the below figure shows the output for default verbosity level of uvm. it will print or gives the information about the statement whose verbosity level is equal to or less than UVM_MEDIUM. To know the default verbosity in the uvm will use a command `drv.get_report_verbosity_level()`. The run_test() will give the UVM_REPORT details.

# 3. **UVM_action**   

UVM_action is the behaviour of the simulator during each uvm_severity defined.     

  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/110484152/198249549-2c421eeb-c7e7-47de-b7b5-c54ddcb8ac0c.png)


                                                       Fig 1 : UVM_action 
 
There are in total six Simulator behaviours which can be associated with a particular UVM Reporting Severity depending upon the users choice.   

1. **UVM_EXIT**    
   Exit from simulation immediately.  

2. **UVM_COUNT**    
   Increment global error count  

3. **UVM_DISPLAY**    
   Display message on console  

4. **UVM_LOG**  
   Captures message in a named file    

5. **UVM_CALL_BACK**    
   Calls callback method  

6. **UVM_NO_ACTION**   
     It will not display the output for the particular severity used.
      Example: class_handle.set_report_severity_action(UVM_INFO, UVM_NO_ACTION)  
     Here, in this above example it will not display the output statement for the UVM_INFO severity. because the action decide the output statement         


The default simulator action  associated with each of these Severity.  

1. UVM_FATAL  - UVM_DISPLAY | UVM_EXIT  
2. UVM_ERROR  - UVM_DISPLAY | UVM_COUNT  
3. UVM_WARNING - UVM_DISPLAY  
4. UVM_INFO  -  UVM_DISPLAY  


**code snippet**

    `include "uvm_macros.svh"
    import uvm_pkg::*;

    class rpting extends uvm_component;

       `uvm_component_utils(rpting)

      function new(string name,uvm_component parent);
        super.new(name, parent);
      endfunction

      task run();

       uvm_report_info(get_full_name(),
       "This is information 1",UVM_NONE,`__FILE__,`__LINE__);

       uvm_report_info(get_full_name(),
       "This is information 2",UVM_LOW);

       uvm_report_info(get_full_name(),
       "This is information 3",150);

       uvm_report_info(get_full_name(),
       "This is information 4",UVM_MEDIUM);

       uvm_report_warning(get_full_name(),
       "Warning Messgae from rpting",UVM_LOW);

       uvm_report_error(get_full_name(),
       "Error Message from rpting \n\n",UVM_LOW);
       endtask
     endclass

     module top;

      rpting rpt1;
      rpting rpt2;
      rpting rpt3;

      initial begin
        rpt1 = new("rpt1",null);
        rpt2 = new("rpt2",null);
        rpt3 = new("rpt3",null);

        //Do nohing when error message occur
        rpt1.set_report_severity_action(UVM_ERROR,UVM_NO_ACTION);
        // capture the message in named file
        rpt2.set_report_id_action("rpt2",UVM_LOG);
        // terminate when error message occur 
        rpt3.set_report_severity_id_action(UVM_ERROR,"rpt3",UVM_EXIT);
          
        run_test();
       end
     endmodule

**Simulator Action Methods Usage** 

UVM allows to bind a Reporting Severity with a particular valid Simulator Action. Usually its done inside the start_of_simulation() phase.  

Actions can be assigned using set_report_*_action() functions. These can be done for one or all in the priority order from lowest to highest.  

Current Level 
 
* `set_report_severity_action(Severity, Action);`
* `set_report_id_action(ID, Action);`  
* `set_report_severity_id_action(Severity, ID, Action);`

**Explanation**  
   
Here in this first `set_report_severity_id_action()` is called and when uvm_error message comes it will exit from the simulation and it will not execute other two functions.
